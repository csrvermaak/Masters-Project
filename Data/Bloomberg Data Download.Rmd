This file downloads pricing data for the SP500, EAFE, GSCI and NAREIT from Bloomberg.

Download data is converted to monthly data between 31/12/1971 until 31/12/2016 to be able to replicate Faber's original research. At a later stage this can be modified to daily or weekly data if required.

All indices are total return indices provided by Bloomberg.
